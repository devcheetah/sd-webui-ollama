Ollama extension assumes you already know how to run Ollama locally or know the URL for an instance of Ollama.  It assumes you have already pulled models.

**WARNING:  Although you should know this, ollama locally takes up resources which in turn will take resources away from image generation.  I suggest using small models and if you already have little V/RAM, I wouldnt use it at all.** 

Configurations can be found in the settings tab of Forge UI
